Planning Your Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

1. Identify and Understand the Busines Needs

a) Determine the long-term goal of the product or service and write it down.

b) Answer the question "Why are we doing this project?"

c) Identify the **success criteria** that will indicate whether or not the product or service is successful. [If you master something, you learn how to do it properly or you succeed in understanding it completely.](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/master-a-subject#:~:text=If%20you%20master%20something%2C%20you,succeed%20in%20understanding%20it%20completely.) 

Hence, mastering web security has been successful if we either ```learn how to do it properly``` or we ```succeed in understanding it completely```.
